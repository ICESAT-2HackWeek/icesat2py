icepyx is both a software library and a community composed of ICESat-2 data users, 
developers, and the scientific community. 
We are working together to develop a shared library of resources - 
including existing resources, new code, tutorials, and use-cases/examples - 
that simplify the process of querying, obtaining, analyzing, and manipulating 
ICESat-2 datasets to enable scientific discovery.
