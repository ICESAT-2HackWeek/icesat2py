**Python tools for obtaining and working with ICESat-2 data**




Origin and Purpose
------------------

A library to simplify the process of downloading and manipulating ICESat-2 data to enable scientific discovery.
icepyx aims to provide a clearinghouse for code, documentation, examples,
and educational resources that tackle disciplinary research questions while minimizing
the amount of repeated effort across groups utilizing similar datasets.

Many of these tools began as Jupyter Notebooks developed for and during the cryosphere themed ICESat-2 Hackweek
at the University of Washington in June 2019 or as scripts written and used by the ICESat-2 Science Team members.
This project combines and generalizes these scripts into a unified framework, making them accessible for everyone.
