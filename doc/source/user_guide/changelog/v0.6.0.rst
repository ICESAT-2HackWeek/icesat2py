What's new in 0.6.0 (4 March 2022)
-----------------------------------

These are the changes in icepyx 0.6.0 (0.6.1) See :ref:`release` for a full changelog
including other versions of icepyx.

Release 0.6.0 turned into release 0.6.1 due to a tagging + timing issue where the last pull request
was merged after the tag was created.
Increasing the version to 0.6.1 enabled us to quickly troubleshoot and fix our available builds,
but a new release log was not created.
