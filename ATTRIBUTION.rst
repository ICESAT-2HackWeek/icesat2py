Attribution Guidelines
======================

We are extremely grateful to everyone who has contributed to the success of the icepyx community, 
whether through direct contributions to or feedback about icepyx or as developers or maintainers of complimentary resources that are included within the icepyx ecosystem. 
This document outlines our goals to give appropriate attribution to all contributors to icepyx in ways that are fair and diverse and supportive of professional goals. 
To do so, we define broadly *contributions* as:

    Efforts towards achieving icepyx's goals, including writing code, tests, or documentation,
    development of example workflows, development, significant contributions, or maintenance of
    a tailored package that broadens the functionality of icepyx, feedback and suggestions,
    community building, etc.

We use the terms "contributors", "developers", and "authors" interchangeably.
We aim recognize contributions in the following ways.



Contributors List
-----------------
This project follows the `all-contributors <https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors>`_ specification. 
When you contribute to icepyx for the first time or in a new way, you or a maintainer should have the `All Contributors bot
open a PR <https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage>`_` to recognize your contribution with `@all-contributors please add @<username> for <contributions>`.
This will add you to the ``CONTRIBUTORS.rst`` file located in the top level directory; 
the file is packaged and distributed with icepyx. 



Example Workflows
-----------------
Many of the example workflows included within icepyx were developed by individuals or small teams for educational or research purposes. 
We encourage example developers to provide proper recognition for these efforts both within the notebook itself and 
by adding contributors to the `Contributors List`_ for attribution as describered herein.


Version Release on Zenodo
-------------------------
Each new release of icepyx is `archived on Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/record/7754482>`_.
We consider each of our contributors to be a co-author, and collectively represent the icepyx authors in citations as "icepyx Developers".
As described above, a complete list of co-authors and their contribution types is available via the `Contributors List`_.

One way to identify significant, frequent contributions could be through the number of commits made to the repository (``git shortlog -sne``)
 and active engagement on GitHub (e.g. through issues, discussions, and pull requests) and Discourse.
However, the use of squash merges into the development branch can mask the relative complexity of various contributions.



Peer-Reviewed Publications (Papers)
-----------------------------------

Authorship on scientific papers currently constitutes an important metric for assessing scientific merit and contribution 
and is often directly linked to career advancement. 
We aim to write academic papers for our software and its uses. 
To be eligible for authorship on peer-reviewed publication, contributors must:

  1. Contribute to the development (including code, documentation, and examples) of icepyx. Substantial non-code contributions constitute eligibility for authorship.
  2. Contribute ideas, participate in authorship discussions (see next paragraph), write, read, and review the manuscript in a timely manner, and provide feedback (acknowledgement of review is sufficient, but we'd prefer more).

Author order will be determined based on co-author discussion, led by the lead author, during the initial planning stages 
of manuscript preparation (i.e. as soon as an idea matures into a potential manuscript and before writing begins). 
Authorship will continue to be evaluated throughout the manuscript preparation process. 
Discussions will consider authorship norms (e.g. How does author order convey participation and prestige? 
How critical is first authorship to career advancement for each member of the team? 
Do an individual's contributions meet authorship criteria or are they more suited to acknowledgements?). 
Author order determination may also consider metrics such as the number of commits since the last major release 
with an associated paper (``git shortlog vX.0.0...HEAD -sne``), contributions that do not have associated commits, 
and contributions to the preparation of the manuscript.


    Disclaimer: These policies are not permanent or fixed and may change to accomodate community growth,
    best practices, and feedback.
