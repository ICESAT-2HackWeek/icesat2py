# icepyx
Python tools for obtaining and working with ICESat-2 data

## Origin and Purpose
A library to simplify the process of downloading and manipulating ICESat-2 data to enable scientific discovery. icepyx aims to provide a clearinghouse for code, documentation, examples, and educational resources that tackle disciplinary research questions while minimizing the amount of repeated effort across groups utilizing similar datasets.

Many of these tools began as Jupyter Notebooks developed for and during the cryosphere themed ICESat-2 Hackweek at the University of Washington in June 2019 or as scripts written and used by the ICESat-2 Science Team members. This repo combines and generalizes these scripts into a unified framework, making them accessible for everyone.

## Installation

To use icepyx, fork this repo to your own account, then `git clone` to your system. Within the `icepyx` repo directory on your system, you can run `pip install -e .`, and you should then be able to `import icepyx` in Python/iPython, with the option to modify the source code (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs). In the future, we hope to support installation via `conda-forge`.
