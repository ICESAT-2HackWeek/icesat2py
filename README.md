Python tools for obtaining and working with ICESat-2 data

## Origin and Purpose
A library of functions to simplify the process of downloading and manipulating ICESat-2 data to enable scientific discovery. Many of these tools began as jupyter notebooks developed for and during the ICESat-2 Hackweek at the University of Washington in June 2019 or as scripts written and used by the ICESat-2 Science Team members. This repo seeks to combine and generalize these scripts into a Python package.

## Installation

Right now this library is only available as a github repo.

## Examples

Coming soon...
